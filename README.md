# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID from a route parameter as an integer without verifying if it's actually a number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is not a valid integer.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks input validation. If the `:id` parameter in the route is not a valid integer, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, and the subsequent `users.find` operation may throw an error or return unexpected results.  This leads to unpredictable behavior and can cause server crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to ensure that `userId` is a valid integer before attempting to access the `users` array.  This improved error handling prevents unexpected behavior and crashes.
